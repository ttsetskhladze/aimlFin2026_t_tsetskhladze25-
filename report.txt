# Task 3 — Web Server Log File Analysis (DDoS Detection)

**Author:** Tatia Tsetskhladze  
**Date:** 12/Feb/2026

## 1. Event Log File

The web server log file for analysis can be found [here](t_tsetskhladze25_98745_server.log).

## 2. Objective

Detect the time interval(s) of a potential **DDoS attack** by analyzing the number of requests per minute using regression analysis.

## 3. Methodology

1. **Data Extraction**
   - Parsed timestamps from the log file.
   - Aggregated the number of requests per minute.

2. **Regression Analysis**
   - Applied a sliding window linear regression to detect expected request trends.
   - Identified significant deviations above the trend (mean + 3*std) as potential DDoS attacks.

3. **Visualization**
   - Plotted requests per minute and regression trend.
   - Highlighted DDoS periods in red.

Regression Analysis

To detect abnormal traffic:

A sliding window linear regression was applied to the time series.

Window size: 10 consecutive minutes.

This predicts the expected request trend at each point.

Calculate a threshold for abnormal activity:

Threshold = Mean trend + 3 × Standard deviation

Any minute with requests above this threshold is flagged as a potential DDoS attack.


## 4. Code Snippets

```python
# Parse timestamps
timestamps = parse_log("t_tsetskhladze25_98745_server.log")

# Aggregate requests per minute
requests_per_min = timestamps.dt.floor('T').value_counts().sort_index()

# Regression analysis
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)


5. Results

The estimated DDoS attack time interval(s) is:

From: 2026-02-12 14:35:00
To: 2026-02-12 14:50:00

(Exact times may vary depending on log aggregation granularity.)

6. Conclusion

Using regression analysis, we identified periods where the request rate significantly deviated from expected trends, indicating a DDoS attack. The methodology and source code allow reproducibility for further log files.
